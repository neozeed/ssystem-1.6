			INSTALLATION NOTES
			==================

  Depending on your system follow the instructions below.


	****************************************************************
	* BEFORE YOU RUN SSYSTEM TAKE A LOOK AT THE CONFIGURATION FILE *
	* (ssystem.conf) THERE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO (UN)SET OPTIONS THAT  *
	* WILL HELP YOU TO TUNE THE PERFORMANCE AND/OR VISUAL QUALITY  *
	****************************************************************

LINUX/UNIX
----------

  Required libraries:

	- OpenGL 1.2 compliant libraries and glut 3.7. If unsure about that 
	  i suggest you Mesa 3.0 (download also Demos distribution if you 
	  want glut 3.7).

	- Independent JPEG Group's JPEG library. Most Linux systems include
	  this library but if your system doesn't include it you can grab it
	  from ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg

  Once all required stuff is ready simply edit Makefile, run make and
 hopefully it's done. 


WINDOWS
-------

	-Make sure you have OPENGL32.DLL GLU32.DLL and GLUT32.DLL. If you 
	 don't, download them from ssystem homepage.
		 ( http://www1.las.es/~amil/ssystem )

	 DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE MESA FOR 3DFX IF YOU DON'T HAVE A 3DFX CARD
	 DOWNLOAD THE MICROSOFT OPENGL INSTEAD.

	-ssystem's behavior is quite strange under some OpenGL drivers.
	 AFAIK is not ssystem's fault. Contact your card vendor for
	 a driver update.

	-DLLs with 3Dfx hardware support are available from ssystem homepage.
	 Unless these DLLs are in the same directory as ssystem.exe or in your
	 search path (first method is preferred) the program will use default 
	 OpenGL DLLs (if installed) and framerate will be VERY POOR.
