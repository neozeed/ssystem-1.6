- Find a hack to eliminate the "jumping planet" effect

- More satellites

- Shadows/Eclipses

- Comets

- Earth real time weather update

- Add gravity

	- Spaceships, probes, ...

	- Scenarios (transfer orbit flights, fly-by, orbit insertion, ...)

- Better user interface (maybe an alternative GUI version)

- Top view map (multiwindow version?)

Mmm, sounds great but some of these issues won't be easy to code, so if you 
feel like you can help with one of those (or other things you may consider
interesting) join the ssystem development team.
