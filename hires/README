			HIGH RESOLUTION MAPS
			====================

	Starting with v1.5 ssystem defaults to high-res maps. With the new
  texture handling method, ssystem is no longer limited by texture buffer size.
  Since ssystem uses only the maps of those bodies near the camera, you should
  make sure those maps are smaller than your texture buffer, so there's no
  texture cache trashing. Of course, if you're running ssystem on a software
  only  OpenGL driver you don't have to care about this ... it will run slow
  anyway ;-)

  	For those of you with new generation 3d cards with plenty of texture 
  buffer and/or AGP 2X modes, higher resolutions maps are available from
  ssystem homepage (http://www1.las.es/~amil/ssystem).

	If you download a high-res map put it in this directory, then edit
  the ssystem.conf file and set body texture filename to hires/filename.jpg.

  I'M LOOKING FOR HIGH-RES EARTH CLOUD MAPS, IF YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND SUCH
  A MAP PLEASE LET ME KNOW.
