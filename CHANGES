--------------


-Linux "Core dumped bug" fixed




-------------
3/13/98: v1.1
-------------

-Code reorganization

-A few satellites added (Moon, Io, Callisto, Ganymede, Europa, Titan)

-On screen help available

-New camera handling routines (see README for details)

-Minor updates/bug fixes



------------
5/2/98: v1.2
------------

-Updated textures (Mercury, Ganymede, Callisto, Europa, Titan, Saturn Rings)

-New satellites (Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Triton, Charon)

-New Sun and Saturn Rings look (alpha blending)

-Two new command line options, "-slices" and "-stacks" (see README for details)

-Windows Screen Saver version (see scrsaver/README in windows distribution)

-Fixed a bug in satellites positioning algorithm, orbits planes are OK now

-More realistic planets' radii

-Minor updates



-------------
7/26/98: v1.3
-------------

-Fixed a bug in "no lighting" mode

-Distant bodies labels

-Enhanced textures

-Mouse and Joystick support

-Command line option for FULL SCREEN mode (-fullscreen)

-New speed control method

-Minor updates



-------------
9/13/98: v1.4
-------------

-Fixed bugs in satellites positioning code

-Two new camera modes (Body to Body and Orbiter, see README for details)

-Great performance improvement, especially when running hardware accelerated.
 (now SLICES and STACKS default to 20 instead of 12, but even with this
 quality improvement program runs faster than ever)
 
-Earth, Moon, Mars and Jupiter high resolution textures (see hires/README)

-Real Time mode added

-New fullscreen modes under windows 95 (see README for details)

-Local time display in HUD


-------------
12/1/98: v1.5
-------------

-Smart texture handling (high-res maps on 3dfx cards, maps larger than texture
 buffer and grayscale maps detection)

-Textures update

-Brighter Stars labels

-On the fly star brightness control

-FOV control

-More performance improvement (about 20%)

-Primitive framerate control  (see command line options section in README)

-Configuration file. This will let you use your own elements, define new
 bodies, easily add rings and initialize parameters (demo mode, local time,
 detail level, data directory, ...).

-Current planet trail

-Ability to save screenshots

-A few accuracy bugs fixed



-------------
2/26/99: v1.6
-------------

-New Earth, Saturn, Io and Europa texture maps

-Atmosphere rendering ('a' toggles it on/off)

-Flattening support (at last!, Jupiter and Saturn look more realistic)

-Updated configuration file stuff (more readable and versatile, see ssystem.conf)

-Asteroids (just a few and with a pseudo-random shape)

-Deimos and Phobos (disabled by default, edit ssystem.conf to enable them)

-Stars color based on their spectral type

-Brighter stars are now textured objects

-Improved "Linked" camera mode

-New Sun texture (see sun section in ssystem.conf)

-New planet positioning algorithms (based on VSOP87 theory, see bodies section
				   in ssystem.conf)

-Improved trail support

-Updated linux joystick support (you'll NEED 1.x joystick driver)

-A nifty opening screen

-Code clean up

-The usual bunch of bug fixes
